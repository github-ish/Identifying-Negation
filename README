# Identifying-Negation
Identifies wether intent of nouns is positive or negative in a sentnece.

Below are few examples:

**Input :**
  I want coffee with no cream and extra sugar. 
Output:
  negative list set ([(u'no',), (u'cream',)]) 
  positive list set ([(u'coffee',), (u'I',), (u'extra',u'sugar')])
Input:
  I want coffee, but without any foam and cream

Output:
  negative list set ([(u'any', u'foam', u'and', u'cream'), (u'cream',), (u'any',), (u'and',), (u'foam',)])
  positive list set ([(u'coffee',), (u'I',)])

There are 2 files command.py and assignment.py 
Need to run the file assignment.py
Both of them have to be stored in same directory.
The code uses NLTK package and Stanford parser.
Wrapper for Stanford parser in python can be installed as follows:
Details can be found on https://github.com/dasmith/stanford-corenlp-python 
Both the code files need to be stored in the folder stanford-corenlp-python.

Some parts of code can be configured using command line. 
Below are the command line options:
    • -h: print the help message
    • -s ‘sentence’: Analyses the given sentence assuming a default list
    of negative words
    • -n: specifies that a file needs to be used to get new list of
    negative words. File needs to be provided with –f option. This
    option needs to be accompanies with –f option.
    • -f File name: specifies the file from which a list of negative words
    can be read
    • -l: specifies to use a file to read a list of sentences to be
    ananlysed.
    • -t File Name: specifies the file containing the list of sentences
    
Have also provided two sample files – one for negative words(file.txt) and other for sentences (sentences.txt)

Commands:
    • python assignment.py –h – displays help msg
    • python assignment.py –s “I would like to test this sentence.” –
    analyses the given sentence using default negative word list.
    • Python assignment.py –l –t sentences.txt – analyses all the sentences in
    the given file using default negative word list.
    • Python assignment.py –n –f file.txt –s” I would like to test this sentence.” -– analyses the given sentence using the word list in file.txt
    • Python assignment.py –n –f file.txt –l –t sentences.txt - analyses all the sentences in the given file using the word list in file.txt
    The code might take time to run due to loading of all corenlp Stanford modules.
